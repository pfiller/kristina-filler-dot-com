# Caveman Cookies Branding

[Caveman Cookies](http://www.cavemancookies.com/) makes chewy, delicious gluten-free cookies. I designed the logo, packaging, website, trade show collateral and t-shirts for this brand and have loved watching it grow from 1 flavor to 5. The happy caveman mascot helps show that the brand adheres to the Caveman Diet but the bright, fun imagery makes it clear that these cookies are no boring diet food. The satisfying, zingy flavors are fun to eat and addictive. Buy some Caveman Cookies or Caveman swag [from their store](http://www.cavemancookies.com/).
