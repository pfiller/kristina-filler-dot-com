# Fish's Eddy Brooklynese Set

[Fish's Eddy](http://www.fishseddy.com/) is a fabulous NY-based store with a great collection of artist-driven dinnerware. My line, "Brooklynese" was inspired by the Brooklyn accent. I dare you to look at these and not be tempted to say the words "cawfee" and "shuguh".

You can [buy the set on their site](http://www.fishseddy.com/browse.cfm/2,108.html)
