# Painted Picture Frames

I've always loved walking into houses that have the walls of their staircase full of pictures. It creates a homey atmosphere and instantly tells stories about the family that lives there. Wanting to create a picture wall of our own, but failing to find interesting picture frames, I started painting them instead. The imagery on each frame was pulled from the enclosed picture. These are part of an ongoing series.
