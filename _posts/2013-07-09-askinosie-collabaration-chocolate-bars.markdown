Working closely with Shawn Askinosie, I designed their [CollaBARation line of chocolate bars](http://www.askinosie.com/p-192-collabaration-gift-pack.aspx). The bars are made in collaboration with another artisan food brand that combines their award-winning bean-to-bar chocolate with an ingredient or sensibility the other brand is known for. Rather than list the ingredients or chocolate percentages, we instead decided to take a more artful approach and displayed the bars' flavor notes via poetry.

This project has been [featured on The Dieline](http://www.thedieline.com/blog/2011/10/19/askinosie-chocolate-dark-milk-chocolate-black-licorice-bar.html) as well as in How Magazine.
