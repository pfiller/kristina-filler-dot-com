Nick, aka [Peanut Butter Boy](http://www.peanutbutterboy.com/) has written a blog about peanut butter for years and finally set out to make his own "super natural" peanut butter. The superhero logo represents his alter-ego as well as the powerfully nutty flavor and natural energy boost you get from eating it. The illustrative outer-space label helps show that his peanut butter is truly out of this world. [Go buy some](http://store.peanutbutterboy.com/).
