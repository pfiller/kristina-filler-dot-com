# CPB Gallery

[The CPB Gallery](http://www.cpbgallery.com/) is my food blog about the world's two best ingredients: chocolate and peanut butter. I started it as a means to be creative in the kitchen and to practice writing and food photography. Through it, I've done all of the above as well as met new friends and clients. My favorite part about it is receiving e-mails from flabbergasted readers who can't believe that there's an entire website dedicated to their favorite flavor combination.
