# Zoku Quick Pops

Becoming ["hangry"](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hangry) is one of the worst things in the world, in my opinion. I have been known to be impatient while waiting for food, especially dessert. So when my friends came out with an ice pop maker that could freeze ice pops in 7 minutes, my perpetually hungry self felt quite relieved.

Quick Pops is a recipe book I co-wrote and designed. It's a book of ice pop recipes formulated specifically for use with their product, The [Zoku Quick Pop Maker](http://www.zokuhome.com/pages/products-quickpop-maker). You can [buy it online](http://www.zokuhome.com/pages/zoku-quick-pops-recipe-book).
