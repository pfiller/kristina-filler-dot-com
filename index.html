  <h2><span>ABOUT</span>KRISTINA FILLER</h2>
  <p>
    Hello!
  </p>
  <p>
    My name is Kristina. I paint like it's my job (it is) and I eat chocolate like it's my job (it's not). I am most interested in working with humans who want to do good for the world, companies that want to promote health and well-being, and those with sustainable and environment-friendly practices. I want to put good, meaningful, thoughtful, funny, weird, amazing work into the world because what is the point in anything else?
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently freelancing and working on a charity project to raise money for <a href="https://everytown.org">Everytown.org</a>, in honor of my dad who was killed by gunfire. Visit <a href="https://www.hold-your-fire.com">Hold Your Fire</a> to read the story or <a href="https://www.bonfire.com/hold-your-fire/">buy the shirt</a>.
