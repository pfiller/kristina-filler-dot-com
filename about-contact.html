<h1>About & Contact</h1>

<p>"Some people have been kind enough to call me a fine artist. I've always called myself an illustrator. I'm not sure what the difference is. All I know is that whatever type of work I do, I try to give it my very best. Art has been my life." - Norman Rockwell

<p>I love design and I love food. I aim to fuse the arts of both of them. I was trained in Communication Arts / Illustration at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY and have been happily working full-time freelance for the past few years. In 2011, I became a published cookbook co-author and designer. In my spare time, I enter bake-offs, paint, bike and travel with my programmer husband, Patrick [http://www.patrickfiller.com/].

<p>My specialties are food packaging and collateral, logos, food photography and wedding invitations. I live in NJ, but work with brands both near and far. Contact me to discuss your project and I'll design you somthin' sweet.
