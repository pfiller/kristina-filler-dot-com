# Askinosie Chocolate Packaging

Askinosie's [Chocolate Hazelnut Spread](http://www.askinosie.com/p-107-hey-hey-hazelnut-chocolate-hazelnut-spread.aspx) is so good that you should stop reading this and go buy some. [Askinosie Chocolate's](http://www.askinosie.com/) branding is a bit industrial-looking like their factory and bold like their flavors. They take pride in having great rapport with their cocoa farmers, whom they feature on a lot of their packaging, like this jar.

You can send their bars to your friends (or yourself) in cool wooden boxes like this one. This was a special holiday box that was custom branded.

Their bars are so delicious, we made up a custom word for it - and a custom t-shirt for the custom word.
