# Paleo Pasta

[Paleo Pasta](http://paleopasta.com/) is a gluten-free pasta company with a vast array of pasta flavors that align with the caveman diet. I designed their logo, packaging and website. The illustrations are a bit rustic looking as a subtle call-back to the ancient caveman era, but each flavor has bright colors that keep it modern and fun and help the packages pop off the shelves.
