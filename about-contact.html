		<blockquote cite="http://www.nrm.org/about-2/about-norman-rockwell/">
			&ldquo;Some people have been kind enough to call me a fine artist. I've always called myself an illustrator. I'm not sure what the difference is. All I know is that whatever type of work I do, I try to give it my very best. Art has been my life.&rdquo; 
			<span>&mdash; Norman Rockwell</span>
		</blockquote>

		<p>I love design and I love food. I aim to fuse the arts of both of them. I was trained in Communication Arts / Illustration at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY and have been happily working full-time freelance for the past few years. In 2011, I became a published cookbook co-author and designer. In my spare time, I bake, paint, bike and travel with my programmer husband, <a href="http://www.patrickfiller.com/">Patrick</a>.</p>

		<p>My specialties are food packaging and collateral, logos, food photography and wedding invitations. I live in NJ, but work with brands both near and far. Contact me to discuss your project and I'll design you somthin' sweet.</p>
