Greyston Bakery makes amazing brownies - so amazing that Ben & Jerry's uses them in their much sought-after ice cream. Aside from baking fabulous treats, Greyston employs the "hard to employ", lending a helping hand to their community in Yonkers, NY. As they like to say, they don't hire people to bake brownies, they bake brownies to hire people. Among many amazing accomplishments, they provide health care, community gardens and package their products in sustainable materials. The pattern on their new packaging is an integrated texture of words that reflect the unique sensibilities behind their amazing brand. To support their efforts, [buy yourself some brownies](http://www.greystonbakery.com/).

You can also find more information in their [digital annual benefit report](http://www.greystonbakery.com/benefitreport/), which I had the honor of designing.
