# Jenna and Matt's Wedding Invite

Jenna spent some time abroad living in England and has a royal symbol (a flour de lis) tattooed on her wrist. Pulling from these elements, I used the silhouette of a family crest as a backdrop for their wedding invitation. It's a subtle symbol of the coming together of two families. The royal elements also hint at the grandeur of their wedding!
