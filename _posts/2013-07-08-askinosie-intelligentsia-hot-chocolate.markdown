# Askinosie + Intelligentsia Sipping Chocolate

This Limited Edition Sipping Chocolate is the stuff that dreams are made of (or my dreams, at least): my favorite bean-to-bar chocolatier combined forces with my favorite Chicagoan coffee roaster and I got to design the container for the [resulting magical treat](http://www.askinosie.com/p-175-limited-edition-sipping-chocolate-intelligentsia-coffee.aspx). The design concept behind Askinosie Chocolate's package design is reminiscent of army supplies with a hand-crafted, high end touch.
